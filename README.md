I anlaysed the dataset tells about few years of high and low price of bitcoin 
And Volume and Adjacent close price of the bitcoin
in dataset has the columns like High,Low,Adjacent close,Volume,year and open price
And analyse the dataset through high and volume price of year
and the  bicoin is higher in the month of may  it has the value of $1286.37G and I analysed a whole year. In this crypto currency  High volume is good because it indicates the lot of interset in the particular coin. This often leads to increase the price of the coin
another sheet I analayed the High and Low price for past years
um of High (actual & forecast) , sum of Low (actual & forecast)  and Date Year.  Color shows details about Date Month.  Size shows sum of High (actual & forecast) .  The marks are labeled by sum of High (actual & forecast) , sum of Low (actual & forecast)  and Date Year.  Details are shown for Date Quarter.

 The Bitcoin network of miners make money from Bitcoin by successfully validating blocks and being rewarded. Bitcoins are exchangeable for fiat currency via cryptocurrency exchanges and can be used to make purchases from merchants and retailers that accept them.
 
 
 
 
 And predict the final result using bitcoin
 In this  above analysis we can predict the future of the high price  ranges between $28.44M  to $38.80M and the low price ranges between $27.15M to $40.46M for the year 2023 Bitcoin price will eventually rise as the macro environment stabilizes over the next couple of years
